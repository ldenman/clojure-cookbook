=== Galley Foreword

Hey. Well look at you, holding that galley copy of the Clojure
Cookbook. It's *heavy*, no? We only printed a dozen of these suckers.

In all seriousness, thank you for taking a look at the book. The
Cookbook has been a long time coming, and a print release such as this
is *cathartic* for any author. What you hold in your hands is the
culmination of hundreds of hours of labor (if not thousands) on the
part of nearly sixty people.

We want you to be one of our contributors too, and that's why you're
holding this _galley_ copy of the book. What you'll find between these
covers is 80% of the finished book footnote:[...and the most
important/challenging 20% of work ahead of us.]. This isn't a full tech
review, but we'd certainly appreciate any feedback you had--be it typos,
suggestions on improving a recipe or recipes you'd like to see included.

Many thanks! We hope you enjoy your time here in Alexandria at the Conj.
